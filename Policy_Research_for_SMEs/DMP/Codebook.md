## Project Description
In this project aims to find out how the awareness of hospitality employees impact the overal security of a hospitality business.

## Study design and data processing; written out or a reference to other docs.


## Data Collection and Cleaning
### Collection of the raw data

**Qualitative Data:**

- Data for the qualitative part of the study was collected through structured interviews with hospitality employees. The interviews were conducted in person or online, recorded with participants' consent, and stored securely. The questions focused on themes such as training experiences, engagement, challenges, and feedback.
- Interviews were designed to capture detailed insights into employee perceptions of cybersecurity practices, their relevance to daily tasks, and suggestions for improvement.

**Quantitative Data:**

- Survey data were collected using a Qualtrics questionnaire. The survey included questions with ordinal and nominal scales, designed to measure factors such as awareness, confidence, and the perceived impact of cybersecurity practices.
- Responses were exported as .CSV files to ensure compatibility with statistical analysis tools.

### Cleaning of the data

**Qualitative Data:**

- Interview recordings were transcribed using AI-powered transcription software. Each transcription was reviewed and corrected manually by two independent researchers to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Thematic coding was applied to organize and analyze qualitative responses, identifying recurring patterns and key themes relevant to the research objectives.

**Quantitative Data:**

- Survey responses were encoded into numerical values for statistical analysis. For example, ordinal variables such as "confidence levels" were assigned numeric codes (e.g., 1 = Very confident, 5 = Not confident at all).
- A translation table was created to retain the original categorical data for reference during analysis.
- The data was checked for inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers. Any issues identified were documented, and adjustments were made as necessary to maintain data integrity.
